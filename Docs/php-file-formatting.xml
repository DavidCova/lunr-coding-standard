        <title>Maximum Line Length</title>
        <para>The target line length is 80 characters. That is to say, developers should strive keep each line of their code under 80 characters where possible and practical. However, this is not always feasible and as such longer lines are acceptable. However developers should still strive to keep the line length within reasonable measures. 120 characters is already quite long, and is the soft-limit. The maximum length of any line of PHP code is 130 characters.</para>

        <title>Line Termination</title>
        <para>Line termination follows the Unix text file convention. Lines must end with a single linefeed (LF) character. Linefeed characters are represented as ordinal 10, or hexadecimal 0x0A.</para>
        <para>Note: Do not use carriage returns (CR) as is the convention in Apple OS's (0x0D) or the carriage return - linefeed combination (CRLF) as is standard for the Windows OS (0x0D, 0x0A).</para>
